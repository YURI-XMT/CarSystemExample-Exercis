Key Improvements:
Naming Conventions: Used clear, descriptive variable names with a trailing underscore for private/protected members, following common C++ style guides.
Consistency: Standardized method names (e.g., StartEngine instead of startEngine) using PascalCase for public methods.
Explicit Constructor: Marked the Car constructor as explicit to prevent implicit conversions.
Virtual Destructor: Explicitly declared the base class destructor as virtual and used = default for clarity.
Comments: Added concise comments to explain the purpose of classes and key methods, improving readability.
Professional Output: English output messages are clear and professional, suitable for a production environment.
Code Structure: Organized the code with proper spacing and logical grouping for maintainability.

A base Car class with common features (e.g., engine status).
Two derived classes, Pride and Benz, inheriting from Car.
Unique features: ESP for Benz and a basic feature (e.g., manual windows) for Pride.
Common features accessible to both, while unique features are exclusive to their respective classes.
Since you didn’t provide additional details, I’ll make reasonable assumptions:

Common features: engine status (on/off) and a method to display it.
Unique features: ESP for Benz (with a method to toggle it), manual windows for Pride (as a boolean attribute).
Protected access for base class attributes, with public methods for interaction.
Simple console output to display car status.
